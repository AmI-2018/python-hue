# Philips Hue lamps control in Python

This repository contains two basic scripts for testing the Philips Hue APIs from Python. The available files include:

* `rest.py` an helper for easily sending request to a given API endpoint with a specific payload, and using a given HTTP verb
* `hue.py` a simple application for the Philips Hue API that turns all the available lamps on, in color-loop mode

_Please, notice that the `username` present in the code is provided as an example, and it is expected not to work. To get a proper username, please, follow the official Philips Hue "[Getting Started guide](https://www.developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started)"._
